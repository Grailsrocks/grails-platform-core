h1. pluginConfig

This read-only property is added to all Grails artefacts provided by plugins.

Artefacts can use this to access the configuration values that pertain to their plugin only.

Example:

{code}
class MyPluginService {
    def doSomething() {
       if (pluginConfig.enabled) {
          println "It worked!"
       }
    }
}

This provides a valuable shortcut to accessing config that removes the responsibility to maintain this information from your code.
